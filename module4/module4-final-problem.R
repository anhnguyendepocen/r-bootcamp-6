###***FINAL PROBLEM: Write a function with the following signature:
###***meanWithNA <- function(x)
###***Assume x is a vector and has NAs. Write the function such that it eliminates NAs
###***and returns the mean of the remaining values in the vector. If the length of 
###***remaining values is 0, have the function return NA.
###***Use this function to revise your rowMeans for each data.frame in mouseExpList 
###***(provided as an data object in module4). 
###***Write another function with the following signature:
###***compareMTwithRowMean <- function(mazeTime, rowMean)
###***and have it output a vector that is 1 if mazeTime < rowMean, 0 if not. 
###***Apply this function to mazeTime3 and rowMean. Count the number of 1s and 0s
###***for each data set.  Based on this number, do you think the mice learned how
###***to run the maze faster?
