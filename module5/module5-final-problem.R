###***FINAL PROBLEM: Join all three tables using the associated IDs (MouseID, ExperimentID) 
###***and look at the following:
###***1) Is there a Strain-specific difference in the mean Balance Time?
###***(Use your tapply() skills!)
###***2) Are there any other categorical variables associated with strain in the data?
###***(Make some cross tables like I did with Date and LabtechID)
###***3) If so, does this make your conclusion from 1) stronger or weaker? Why?
