####QUESTION 1-1: How would we get the last 5 weights?
####QUESTION 1-2: How would we get the first 5 weights in reverse order?
####QUESTION 1-3: what happened here? Why can we subtract a scalar
####from a vector?
####QUESTION 1-4: what happens when you try to subtract two vectors of unequal lengths?
####QUESTION 1-5: what happens when you try to mix characters and
####numbers?  What does this tell you about vectors?
####QUESTION 1-6: how might you combine c() and a series of names to
####pull out only the "M1", "M5", and "M10" weights?
####this operation is called subsetting, and we'll cover it more 
####in detail later.
####QUESTION 1-7: What can you say about the distribution of weights?
####i.e., are they distributed normally?

####QUESTION 2-1: what happens when you access the Gender column?
####How does it differ from the weights column?
####Hint: use class() to compare the different columns
####QUESTION 2-2: How many Males and Females are there?
####Is this a balanced design?

####QUESTION 3-1: what happens when you use a boolean vector that's shorter than the number
####of columns? What happens with the remaining columns?  Are they returned?
####QUESTION 3-2: How would we select every third row? Hint: help("%%")
####QUESTION 4-1: What does the comparator operator 
####weights < 50
####generate? Why does it work?
####QUESTION 4-2: What does 
####QUESTION 4-3: how do you select females of strain D2?
####QUESTION 4-4: How would we select those mice with a weight

####QUESTION 5-1: what does order() do? How can you use it to sort a data frame?
####QUESTION 5-2: How can we sort the data frame by Strain then Weight?
####QUESTION 5-3: What does the sample() code below do?  How
####QUESTION 5-4: Produce a bootstrap sample without replacement of 7 rows
