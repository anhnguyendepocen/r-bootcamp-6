Bioconductor is a universe unto itself. 

Part of what makes Bioconductor work is that they were very smart in specifying data structures for bioinformatic problems we do lots of work with.

For expression data, there is the ExpressionSet.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

For genomic data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
