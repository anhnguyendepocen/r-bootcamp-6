r-bootcamp
==========

Draft Tutorial for self directed bootcamp for learning R-programming basics.

Each folder contains a different module.  Each folder contains a file, ex. "module1.R" 
that is meant to be loaded as a script into an IDE such as RStudio.  By working through
the script, basic concepts of R and its data structures are taught.

The content of each module is as follows:

1. Getting Help, Loading, Saving, Data QC, Scripting
2. Vectors, Data Frames, Subsetting, Filtering and Ordering
3. Matrices, Iterating, Applying, Deciding and Lists
4. Merging, Visualizing, Functions and Scope
5. Databases, Packages, and Beyond.

Each folder contains the following files:
  moduleX.R - The script
  moduleX.RData - workspace consisting of data to manipulate
  moduleX-test-your-knowledge.R - Multiple Choice Quiz to test your knowledge
  moduleX-problem-set.R - All the problems in moduleX in an easy to read format (these
    are also included in ModuleX.R)
  moduleX-final-problem.R - Final assignment
